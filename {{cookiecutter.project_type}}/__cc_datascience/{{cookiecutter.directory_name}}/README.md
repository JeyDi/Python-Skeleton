{{cookiecutter.project_description}}

## Setup
1. Install git and checkout the [git code repository]
2. Install [anaconda] python version 3.6+
3. Change working directory into the git code repository root
4. Create the self contained conda environment. In a terminal go to the git code repository root and enter the command:

   `conda env create --file conda_env.yml`

5. Any python modules under src need to be available to other scripts. This can be done in a couple of ways. You can 
setup and install the python modules by executing the setup.py command below which will install the packages to the 
conda environments site-packages folder but with a symlink to the src folder so modifications are reflected immediately. 

   `python setup.py develop`
   
    As an alternative you may prefer to set the python path directly from the console, within notebooks, test scripts 
    etc. From Pycharm you can also right click the src folder and select the _Mark Directory As | Source Root_ option.

6. .. Place your own project specific setup steps here e.g. copying data files ...

When distributing your module, you can create a Python egg with the command `python setup.py bdist_egg` and upload the egg.

NOTE: When working in the project notebooks from within the Equinor network, you may need to include the lines below if your proxy is not otherwise setup.

`os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']="http://www-proxy.statoil.no:80"`<br />
`os.environ['HTTPS_PROXY']="http://www-proxy.statoil.no:80"`

## Using the Python Conda environment

Once the Python Conda environment has been set up, you can

* Activate the environment using the following command in a terminal window:

  * Windows: `activate <conda_env_name>`
  * Linux, OS X: `source activate <conda_env_name>`
  * The __environment is activated per terminal session__, so you must activate it every time you open terminal.

* Deactivate the environment using the following command in a terminal window:

  * Windows: `deactivate <conda_env_name>`
  * Linux, OS X: `source deactivate <conda_env_name>`
               
* Delete the environment using the command (can't be undone):

  * `conda remove --name <conda_env_name> --all`

## MLOps
Starter scripts for MLOps with Azure ML Service are included as a part of this template in the scripts folder and may be
customised for your own purposes. Please browse the contents of the scripts folder for more details.

For model training, the provided setup allows for running locally without any dependency on Azure ML by running train.py
in the scripts/train folder directly. Alternatively you can submit local or remote runs using the submit scripts in the 
same folder.

## Testing
Reproducability and the correct functioning of code are essential to avoid wasted time. If a code block is copied more 
than once then it should be placed into a common script / module under src and unit tests added. The same applies for 
any other non trivial code to ensure the correct functioning.

To run tests, install pytest using pip or conda (should have been setup already if you used the conda_env.yml file) and 
then from the repository root run
 
```
pytest
```

## Development Process
Contributions to this template are greatly appreciated and encouraged.

* Ensure that as far as possible there are unit tests covering the functionality of any new code.
* Check that all existing unit tests still pass.
* Edit this document if needed to describe new files or other important information.
* Create a pull request.
