"""
This module should contain project specific feature engineering functionality.

You should avoid engineering features in a notebook as it is not transferable later if you want to automate the
process. Add functions here to create your features, such functions should include those to generate specific features
along with any more generic functions.

Consider moving generic functions into the shared statoilds package.
